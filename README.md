## Twitter INIT
* First step to creating our Twitter clone is by opening up your terminal and cloning our repo using:
  ```js
  git clone https://github.com/Sawmonabo/wundergraph-twitter-clone.git
  ```
* Once you clone the repo you're going to want to run the command ``` npm i ``` to download our current dependencies from our package.json
* After installing the dependencies, go aheah and start the application with ``` npm start ``` to see what we have so far.
<p> As you can see this will load up the skeleton structure of Twitter. Before moving forward, lets take a look at Feed.js located within our src folder. On line 7 we are craeting a const named post which we are currently assigning values to and inserting it into our twitter feed. In TweetBox.js, also within the src folder, is where users will be creating their tweets. Once again we are are currently creating a user and then capturing the input message or image link by the user on the front-end. While the application is still running on localhost:3000 go ahead and open up the dev tools console. If you type in a message and click Tweet you'll be able to see the console log our input.
